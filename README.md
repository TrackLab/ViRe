### ViRe is an open-source VR mocap studio built in Unity

<img align="left" width="420" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35671643/120828443-d1a75680-c55c-11eb-98a9-0e1a459c6636.png" />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
ViRe can be used for anyone who wants to record motion, but cannot afford a huge and expensive motion capture studio. <br />
All you need is a simple VR Setup. ViRe runs on top of SteamVR, the default asset to support all kinds of VR Headsets. <br /><br />

We made a video to showcase and explain ViRe. Simply click on the YouTube logo to watch it. The video is a little outdated compared to ViRes current style, but the general explanations still apply

## ViRe definitely works with the following headsets <br />

<br /> <br /> <br />
It very well may run with other headsets as well, but we can't guarantee it (yet). If it works on an unlisted headset, do tell us. <br />

## ViRe is currently in Alpha

Bugs are still abound and things are missing.

Currently, ViRe supports the tracking of the headset and both hand controllers, as well as procedural movement for those without additional body trackers. But there are lots of other things we plan on adding ([check out the list](#feature-development)) and we're always looking for feedback!

## Support ViRe

As our team is really small, development will be slow. We really appreciate you sticking around for the process and thank you for considering (or maybe actively) contributing.

If you'd like to help develop ViRe, fork it, clone and send us a pull request to update ViRe.

Got a headset we don't have full support for? Help us out by testing! Check out our Discord link below.

Found a bug? Let us know on via that same Discord server!
