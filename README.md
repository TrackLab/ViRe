<br />
ViRe can be used by anyone who wants to record motion but cannot afford a huge and expensive motion capture studio. <br />
All you need is a simple VR Setup. ViRe uses SteamVR, the industry-standard environment supporting all kinds of VR Headsets. <br /><br />

We made a video to showcase and explain ViRe. Simply click on the YouTube logo to watch it. The video is a little outdated compared to ViRe's current style, but the general explanations still apply

## ViRe definitely works with the following headsets <br />

It likely works on other headsets, but you might experience issues like unbound controller buttons. Got a headset we don't list? Tell us!

## ViRe is currently in Beta

While most features are implemented, bugs are still abound.

As we're polishing things up for a "production" release, we really need to hear from you on the [features we support](#feature-development) and how well things are working.

Please reach out to us!
